Kannada film star Upendra announced on Saturday that he will launch a new political party in the state, where Assembly polls are due early next year.
The actor, who has been on and off dropping hints about his political entry, said he plans to form a party that creates a platform for talents who have ideas and skills to solve people's problems. Clad in a khaki shirt, the "real star" as called by his fans, said the dress symbolizes that the party doesn't want 'Jana nayaka' or 'Jana sevaka' (public leader or public servant), but 'Jana karmika' (public worker) who stays in a particular area and honestly works for people there, for a salary. Upendra, who began his film career as a dialogue writer has directed about 10 films and acted in about 50 films. "....giving a complete transparent alternative is my idea. With this intention we plan to launch a party," he told reporters
